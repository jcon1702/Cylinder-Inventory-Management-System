A lightweight Excel-based system to manage, reconcile, and analyze LPG cylinder inventory ‚Äî designed for TotalEnergies Vietnam.

---

## üìò Background

TotalEnergies Vietnam is undergoing a major digital transformation across its energy business lines (LPG, solar, PPA).With over 12 million gas cylinders annually and growing ESG requirements, the company needs a system to:

* Track serial numbers (S/N)

* Reconcile cylinder records across locations and weeks

* Enable data-driven decisions through dashboards and reporting

This project simulates a mock Inventory Management System built in Excel, serving as a hands-on exercise for data analytics and business operation optimization.

## üéØ Objective

* Build an Excel system to track and monitor the status of each cylinder weekly

* Reconcile differences between physical inventory and database records (detect Lost/Damaged units)

* Visualize data using dashboards (Pivot Charts, Slicers)

* Analyze trends: error rates, inventory lifecycle, and usage anomalies

* Create business insights to support ESG reporting and operations

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

* 01\_Input: Master list of cylinders with SerialNumber, DateReceived, Type (12kg/45kg), Initial Status

* 02\_Tracking: Over 1000 records across 4 weeks showing weekly updates (Status, Location, Alert flag)
